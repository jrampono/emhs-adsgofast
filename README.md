# Azure Data Services Go Fast Codebase

## Introduction

The Azure Data Services Go Fast Codebase is a combination of Microsoft components designed to shorten the "time to value" when deploying an Azure Data Platform. Key features include:

- Infrastucture as code (IAC) deployment of MVP Azure Data Platform 
- "Out of the box" Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment framework  
- Enterpise grade security and monitoring with full support for Key Vault, VNETS, Private Enpoints and Managed Service Identities
- Codeless Ingestion from commonly used enterprise source systems into an enterprise data lake
- Users can interact with capabilities through a webpage and embedded dashboards.

This project is composed of Microsoft components and Open-Source Software (OSS) and is provided to customers and partners at no charge. 

At its core this project is intended to be an accelerator. As such, it is designed to accelerate the “time to value” in using the Microsoft components. As an accelerator, is it not for sale, nor is it a supported product.

## Getting Started

Getting started is always the hardest part of any process so help clients & partners get started with this repository we provide a set of online, on-boarding and upskilling workshops. Spaces in these workshops are limited and subject to an application process. If you are intersted then please 
nominate yourself at [https://forms.office.com/r/qbQrU6jFsj](https://forms.office.com/r/qbQrU6jFsj).
  

### Prerequisites

Deployment of this project requires a variety of services across Azure. Please ensure that you have access to these services before continuing on to the deployment section of this guide.

>To get started you will need the following:
>
>- An active Azure Subscription & Empty Resource Group*
>- Owner rights on the Azure Resource Group
>- Power BI Workspace (Optional)

*Note that for a fully functioning deployment the deployment process will create a Deployment Service principal and two Azure Application Registrtions within the Azure Active Directory (AAD) domain that is connected to your Azure subscription. It is recommended that you use an Azure subscription and AAD on which you have the necessary priveleges to perform these operations. 

You can sign up for an Azure subscription [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) 

Once you have your Prerequisite items, please move on to the Deployment Configuration step.

## Deployment Configuration

You will also need some development tools to edit and run the deployment scripts provided. It is recommended you use the following:
>
>- A windows based computer (local or cloud)
>- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
>- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
>- [Windows Store Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N9TNGVNDL3Q)

The deployment uses a concept of **Developing inside a Container** to containerize all the necessary pre-requisite components without requiring them to be installed on the local machine. Follow our [Configuring your System for Development Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) guide.

Once you have set up these pre-requisites you will then need to [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.1/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository to your local machine. 

## Deployment
To deploy the solution open **Visual Studio Code** and carry out the following steps.

>- [ ] From the menu select "File" then "Open Folder". Navigate the directory into which you cloned the solution and from there to "solution/Deployment". Choose this folder to open in Visual Studio Code. 
>- [ ] Next, from the menu, select "View", "Command Palette". When the search box opens type "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container". **Note** that you Docker Desktop needs to be running before you perform this step. 
>- [ ] From the menu select "Terminal", "New Terminal". A new Powershell Core window will open at the bottom of your screen. You are now running within the Docker container.
>- [ ] Deployment specifics are controlled by an environment file. You can set these specifics using a small node web application that is embedded within the source code. To access the application use the Terminal window that was creeated in the previous step and type the following commands: 
```bash
bash
cd environments/Node/
npm install 
node server.js 
```
>- [ ] Next Open an Internet Browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/EditSettings.html. You  should see a screen that looks like the picture belo. For a vanilla deployment you only need to fill out the section titled "Primary Resource Group Settings". Fill this out now with your Azure Environment Specifics and, once done, click on the red button at the top of the form labelled "Click here to update the environment file with form changes".

>- [ ] Next return to the terminal window and press "Ctrl+c" twice to stop your Node application. Next type the following commands:
```powershell
pwsh
cd ../../workflows/
ls
```
>- [ ] You will now see a listing of powershell (*.ps1) files. These are the scripts that drive the deployment. To deploy the solution run the commands below in your terminal window. **Note** it is recommended that you run these one at a time and check output during each command execution for errors. 
```powershell
az login #Logs you in to your Azure environment
./LocalDevOnly_EnvironmentSetUp.ps1 #Loads your environment settings
./CI_1a_BuildCode.ps1 #Builds the source code binaries 
./CD_0a_CreateServicePrincipals_AAD_Elevated.ps1 #Creates your Azure resource group and application registrations
./CD_1a_DeployServices.ps1 #Deploys the core Azure Services     
./CD_2a_CreateMSIs_AAD_Elevated.ps1 #Sets up the Azure Managed Service Identities and grants privileges and access
./CD_2b_ConfigureServices.ps1 #Publishes source code to Azure Services.
```
